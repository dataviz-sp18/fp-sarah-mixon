## Detroit
#### Broadly, this project seeks to provide a picture of at-risk families living in the Detroit, and to provide a meaningful metric that is represented geospatially to help ensure the most vulnerable areas are included in the rebuilding of Detroit. The final visualization is a `flexdashboard` that is best viewed by downloading and running the code locally. 

##### You will need the following packages and libraries: 
`library(flexdashboard)`
`library(tidycensus)`
`library(tidyverse)`
`library(ggplot2)`
`library(sf)`
`library(tmap)`
`library(viridis)`
`library(leaflet)`
`library(stringr)`
`library(highcharter)`

##### And the ACS data used was accessed through the `tidycensus` package. The exact can be found in the .Rmd.
